## Challenge Guidelines

As part of the benchmarking effort, we are hosting a competition and offering prizes for the best-performing submissions on the EvalAI leaderboard on the deadline of **January 7th, 2022, anywhere on Earth**.
 <!-- and will be funded by the SNEL Lab at Emory. -->

### Ranking and Prizes

The challenge evaluates **co-smoothing** performance on 5ms bins, on individual datasets and across all datasets. The overall winner will be chosen by average rank across datasets. For the MC_Maze scaling datasets, each dataset session will be weighted as 1/3 of a dataset in both individual and overall ranking calculations.

Prizes will be provided in the form of Visa gift cards.
- A prize of 3,000 USD will be given for best average rank across tasks.
- A prize of 1,000 USD will be given for best rank on each individual task (and best average rank on 3 scaling datasets).

### Eligibility

To be considered for challenge prizes, teams must submit their methods to the EvalAI challenge before the deadline *and* commit to releasing code for reproducibility. This commitment means that, after the deadline, top contenders will be notified to share their code with the NLB team so that we can validate their submissions, and moreover, that this code must be open-sourced before we transfer funds.
Note that NLB organizers are ineligible for collecting prize money.

In general, we recommend participants to publicly share their code to help promote progress in the field.
